# Sidebar Navigation Enhancements

This branch adds a polished navigation experience to the Blazor Web App by improving the sidebar layout and making the Products module easily accessible.

## What’s Included

- Added **Products** link to the sidebar (`NavMenu.razor`)
- Integrated a custom **Products icon** from the `wwwroot/images` folder
- Reduced vertical spacing between navigation items for a cleaner layout
- Scoped CSS updates in `NavMenu.razor.css` to keep styling modular

## Why This Matters

This milestone improves overall usability by making the Products page discoverable from the main navigation.  
It also demonstrates:
- How to use **scoped CSS** in Blazor  
- How to serve static assets from `wwwroot`  
- How to enhance UI clarity with icons and spacing adjustments  

## Next Steps

- Merge this branch into `main`
- Begin the next module: Edit/Delete product actions or UI polish
